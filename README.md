# Plates...?

That script is an idea that i had when i was organizing the plates. Well, the context is that i have two kind of plates, the white one and the blue one. I usually put the blue plates at the left and the white at the right, but, one day I made a mistake and put all out of order, mixing all plates. So, when I was reorganizing i though, and if made a script to organize it? Well, that is this code.

### A and B
I choose the characters A and B to represent the 
plates, like that:

(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B)\
&nbsp;A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B\
&nbsp;A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B\
&nbsp;A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B\
&nbsp;A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B\
&nbsp;A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B\
&nbsp;A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B\
 \
Obviously, that is supposed to it be randonly like:
(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B)\
&nbsp;A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A\
&nbsp;B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B\
&nbsp;B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A\
&nbsp;A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B\
&nbsp;B &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A\
&nbsp;A &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B\
 \
And is function of the script to put it in order.

simple run `./exec.sh` to run the script.

# self assessment
At the end i started to beeing so lazy and the code finish as a trash that is impossible to make maintenance. So, my note is 4.5/10
